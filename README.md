# World_Weather_Analysis

## Objective
The purpose of this project wass to use weather data to find ideal hotels based on weather prefrences.   This marks the first time I will use APIs.  API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. The APIs used for this project were OpenWeatherMap API,  Google Maps & Places API, and Google Directions API.

### Analysis:
    1.  Collect the data: 
        - NumPy (To generate 1500+ random latitudes and longitudes.)
        - citipy (To list the nearest city to the latitudes and longitudes.)
        - OpenWeatherMap API (To Request the current weather data from each unique city in the list.)
        - JSON (To collect the data and add it to a DataFrame.)
    
    2. Exploratory Analysis with Visualization:
        - Scatter Plots (To show weather data.)
        - Linear Regression (Determine correlations for weather data.)
        - Google Maps & Places API (To create a series of heatmaps.)

    3. Visualize Travel Data:
        - Add pop-up markers to the heatmaps to display information on specific cities based on customer's travel preferences.

    4. Retrieve Weather Data
        - Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap.
        - Retrieve the current weather description for each city.
        - Create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.
        
    5.  Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
        - Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby.
        - Show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.
        
    6. Create a Travel Itinerary Map
        - Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations.
        - Create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.

## Results
### City Latitude vs Maximum Temperature: 
- The temperature decreases when the latitude increases.

### City Latitude vs Humidity, City Latitude vs Cloudiness, and City Latitude vs Wind Speed:
- The markers are all over the place on each map.  I couldn't determine if the latitude affected the humidity, cloudiness, or wind speed.

### Correlation
    - Latitude vs Max Temperature (Northern Hemisphere): The max temperature decreases when the latitude increases.
    - Latitude vs Max Temperature (Southern Hemisphere): Can't determine a strong correlation between the 2 values.

    - Latitude vs Percent Humidity (Northern Hemisphere): Can't determine a strong correlation between the 2 values.
    - Latitude vs Percent Humidity (Southern Hemisphere):  Can't determine a strong correlation between the 2 values.

    - Latitude vs Percent Cloudiness (Northern Hemisphere):  Can't determine a strong correlation between the 2 values.
    - Latitude vs Percent Cloudiness (Southern Hemisphere): Can't determine a strong correlation between the 2 values.

    - Latitude vs Wind Speed (Northern Hemisphere): Can't determine a strong correlation between the 2 values.
    - Latitude vs Wind Speed (Northern Hemisphere): Can't determine a strong correlation between the 2 values.
